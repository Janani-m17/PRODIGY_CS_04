# üõ°Ô∏è **Simple Keylogger**

The Simple Keylogger is a Python program designed to capture and log keystrokes entered by users. It operates silently in the background, recording keystrokes into a text file.

## **Features:**
1. **Keystroke Logging:** The program captures and logs keystrokes entered by users.
2. **Silent Operation:** It operates discreetly in the background without any visible indication to the user.
3. **Customization:** Users can customize the log file name and location according to their preferences.
4. **Termination:** The keylogger can be stopped at any time by pressing a predefined key combination.

## **Components:**
- `on_press(key)`: Function to handle key press events and log keystrokes.
- `on_release(key)`: Function to handle key release events and stop the keylogger.
- `main()`: The main function orchestrating the keylogger's operation and user interaction.

## **How to Use:**
1. Run the program.
2. The keylogger starts capturing keystrokes silently in the background.
3. Press the predefined key combination to stop the keylogger.
4. Access the log file to view the recorded keystrokes.

## **Example:**
Suppose you run the keylogger program and type:

```
Hello, world!
```

The log file will contain:

```
2024-03-11 12:00:01: 'H'
2024-03-11 12:00:02: 'e'
2024-03-11 12:00:03: 'l'
