# Simple Keylogger

## Overview
This is a simple Python keylogger program that captures and logs keystrokes into a text file. It utilizes the `pynput` library to monitor keyboard events.

The `pynput` library allows this keylogger to listen to keyboard events in the background. It provides the `Key` module, which represents keys on the keyboard, and the `Listener` module, which listens for and handles keyboard events.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the `pynput` library using pip:
   ```
   pip install pynput
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (`keylogger.py`).
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```
   python keylogger.py
   ```
4. The keylogger will silently capture keystrokes in the background.
5. Press the escape key (Key.esc) to stop the keylogger.
6. Access the `keylog.txt` file in the same directory to view logged keystrokes.

## Example

Suppose you run the keylogger program and type:

```
Hello, world!
```

The `keylog.txt` file will contain:

```
2024-03-11 12:00:01: 'H'
2024-03-11 12:00:02: 'e'
2024-03-11 12:00:03: 'l'
2024-03-11 12:00:04: 'l'
2024-03-11 12:00:05: 'o'
2024-03-11 12:00:06: ','
2024-03-11 12:00:07: ' '
2024-03-11 12:00:08: 'w'
2024-03-11 12:00:09: 'o'
2024-03-11 12:00:10: 'r'
2024-03-11 12:00:11: 'l'
2024-03-11 12:00:12: 'd'
2024-03-11 12:00:13: '!'
```
